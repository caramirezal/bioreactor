Source data for Figure S11A: Measurements of time-varying activity of fis promoter (in blue) and absorbance (in red) of a culture of the crp deletion mutant of E. coli BW25113 grown in microplates at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.3% glucose, mineral trace elements and 1.2% of the buffering agent HEPES.
The values of fis promoter activity were derived, following data analysis described in Section S2 of Supplementary Information, from GFP reporter data obtained by means of low-copy plasmid bearing a fusion of a gfp reporter gene with the promoter region of fis. See "Materials and methods" for details.
The mean values (PA_mean) and standard errors (PA_std) were computed from 3 replicas (PA_1,PA_2,PA_3).
