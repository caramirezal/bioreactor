Source data for Figure S12C: Measurements of time-varying activity of acs promoter (in blue) and absorbance (in red) of a culture of E. coli BW25113 grown in microplate at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.3% glucose, mineral trace elements and 1.2% of the buffering agent HEPES, after redilution into a low-glucose medium (0.06% glucose), after redilution into a low-glucose medium (0.06% glucose).
The values of acs promoter activity were derived, following data analysis described in Section S2 of Supplementary Information, from GFP reporter data obtained by means of low-copy plasmid bearing a fusion of a gfp reporter gene with the promoter region of acs. See "Materials and methods" for details.
The mean values (PA_mean) and standard errors (PA_std) were computed from 2 replicas (PA_1,PA_2).
