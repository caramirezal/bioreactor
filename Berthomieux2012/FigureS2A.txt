Source data for Figure S2A: Growth rate values (in blue), as computed from the measured absorbance (in red) of a culture of E. coli BW25113 grown in microplate at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.3% glucose, mineral trace elements and 1.2% of the buffering agent HEPES.
The growth rate values were computed following data analysis procedures described in (de Jong et al, 2010).
The mean values (GR_mean) and standard errors (GR_std) were computed from 4 replicas (GR_1,GR_2,GR_3,GR_4). See "Materials and methods" for details.
