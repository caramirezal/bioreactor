Source data for Figure 3B: Intracellular cAMP values (in blue) and measured absorbance (in red) of a culture of E. coli BW25113 grown in microplate at 37蚓 in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.3% glucose, mineral trace elements and 1.2% of the buffering agent HEPES.
The intracellular cAMP values were computed, following the modeling approach described in Section S3 of Supplementary Information, from extracellular cAMP data measured using a commercially-available immunoassay kit (Upstate). See "Materials and methods" for details.
The mean values (cAMP_mean) and standard errors (cAMP_std) were computed from 3 replicas (cAMP_1,cAMP_2,cAMP_3).
