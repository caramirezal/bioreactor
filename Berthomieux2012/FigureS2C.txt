Source data for Figure S2C: Growth rate values (in blue), as computed from the measured absorbance (in red) of a culture of the crp deletion mutant of E. coli BW25113 strain grown in microplate at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.3% glucose, mineral trace elements and 1.2% of the buffering agent HEPES.
The growth rate values were computed following data analysis procedures described in (de Jong et al, 2010).
The mean values (GR_mean) and standard errors (GR_std) were computed from 3 replicas (GR_1,GR_2,GR_3). See "Materials and methods" for details.
