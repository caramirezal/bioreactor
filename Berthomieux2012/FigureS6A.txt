Source data for Figure S6A: Measurements of time-varying activity of pRM promoter and absorbance (in red) of a culture of the cya deletion mutant E. coli BW25113 grown in microplate at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.3% glucose, mineral trace elements and 1.2% of the buffering agent HEPES, under various concentrations of externally-supplied cAMP.
The values of pRM promoter activity were derived, following data analysis described in Section S2 of Supplementary Information, from GFP reporter data obtained by means of low-copy plasmid bearing a fusion of a gfp reporter gene with the promoter region of pRM of phage lambda. See Section S5 of Supplementary Information for details.
For 100 microM of external-supplied cAMP (in black), the mean values (cAMP100_mean) and standard errors (cAMP100_std) were computed from 6 replicas (cAMP100_1,cAMP100_2,cAMP100_3,cAMP100_4,cAMP100_5,cAMP100_6).
